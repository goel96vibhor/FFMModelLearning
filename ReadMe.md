This project aims at finding and analysing impact of possible factors that influence the probability of a keyword getting clicked. The information from these factors is being used as a feedback for differente analyzers. These factors can belong to different set of categories, i.e, in url dependent factors, keyword dependent factors, location and user dependent factors, and a combination of these. The project uses the concept of field aware factorization machines (here the different factors mentioned above are considered as fields). This model finds the interdependency between the different fields and their combinations with the output. The information gained through the system can be used for making changes in the processing end for different taxonomy systems as well as can be used as seperate analyzer entity.
